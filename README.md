# Music-player-using-emotion

## Project Description

The **Emotion-Detecting Music Player** is an program that uses facial emotion recognition to create a personalized music experience. By detecting the user's emotional state through a camera, the player automatically selects and plays music that matches or enhances the detected mood.

## Features

- **Real-Time Emotion Detection:** 
  - Uses a camera to capture and analyze facial expressions to determine the user's current emotion.
  - Supports emotions like Happy, Sad, Fearful, Disgusted, Surprised, Angry, and Neutral.
  
- **Mood-Based Playlist Generation:** 
  - Automatically selects and plays a playlist from a predefined set of mood-based playlists corresponding to the detected emotion.
  
- **User Interface:** 
  - Simple and intuitive interface to start the emotion detection, view the detected emotion, and control music playback.

- **Real-Time Music Streaming:** 
  - Dynamically adjusts the playlist based on the userâ€™s changing emotions during playback.

- **User Input Override:**
  - Allows users to manually select a mood if they prefer a different playlist than what is suggested.
